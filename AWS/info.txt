Core Cloud Concepts
basics before diving n
| Concept                    | Meaning                                            | Example                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **On-Demand Computing**    | Rent compute or storage as needed                  | Launch EC2 instances only when required    |
| **Scalability**            | Increase/decrease resources automatically          | Auto Scaling groups for web traffic spikes |
| **Elasticity**             | Pay only for what you use; release when not needed | S3 charges only for stored GBs             |
| **Fault Tolerance**        | System keeps running despite failure               | Deploy in multiple Availability Zones      |
| **High Availability (HA)** | System stays online with minimal downtime          | Load Balancer spreads traffic              |
| **Global Infrastructure**  | AWS has regions worldwide                          | India (ap-south-1), US East (us-east-1)    |
